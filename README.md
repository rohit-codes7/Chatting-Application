Java Chatting Application
A simple real-time chat application built in Java using Swing for the graphical user interface. This project simulates a basic messaging platform where users can send and receive text messages in a chat window, making it ideal for learning socket programming and building desktop-based applications.

Features
Real-time Messaging: Instant message sending and receiving between the server and client.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Created using Java Swing to provide a chat interface with a look and feel similar to modern messaging apps.
Customizable Components: Includes header icons for profile, video call, and options.
Networking: Uses ServerSocket and Socket classes to establish server-client communication.
Message Formatting: Messages are displayed with timestamps for better readability.
Exit Button Functionality: Allows the application to be closed via a back button.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure that JDK 8 or later is installed.
